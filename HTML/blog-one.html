      <p>Aspects of Data Visualisation</p>
      <p>
        In the 2020 article “Overview of Data Visualisation”, Li explores the
        different definitions of data visualisation from different perspectives
        of study, however, they note that in modern times data visualisation
        comprises of four aspects: namely, real-time interaction, on-the-fly
        processing, visual scalability and user assistance and personalisation.
        These four aspects mean that data visualisation must be able to support
        millions of interactions all whilst remaining in the response time of a
        few milliseconds, supporting on-the-fly visualisations over sets of raw
        data, finally, it has user customisation and other user designed
        features.
      </p>
      <p>Data and Information</p>
      <p>
        Data visualisation is further catagorised into information and
        scientific visualisation. Information data represents abstract
        information and scientific information represents scientific information
        (eg. the human body, the atmosphere, etc). Data itself is catagorised
        into primary and secondary data. Primary data is collected directly by
        the researcher, and secondary data is processed primary data for a
        specific intent. Primary data and secondary data can therefore be
        thought of as data and information, respectively. Data comprises of
        entities and relations. Entities refers to objects, and relations refers
        to the properties of the object. Relations usually do not exist
        independently. Information, on the other hand, comprises of three parts:
        information as an organized arrangement of facts or data, information
        presented as a means of understanding a situation or process, and design
        of control systems. These three parts determine how easily information
        can be extracted, how information relates to certain subjects or
        scenarios, and the feedback that a product gives. Li then goes on to
        give examples of common information and scientific visualisations –
        tables, charts, tress maps and simulations, volume, waveforms
        respectively. Overall, all these traditional types of data visualisation
        have characteristics of readability, recognizability and meaning,
        amongst others.
      </p>
      <p>Human Interpretation and Understanding</p>
      <p>
        Data visualisation relies on human perception and understanding, which
        means that data a visualisation effectiveness is determined by how well
        a particular person can interpret it. Li mentions Haeley’s 2007 theories
        of preattentive processing.
      </p>
      <p>Feature integration theory</p>
      <p>
        Developed by Anne Treisman and Garry Gelade, this theory suggests human
        perceives a stimulus, features are “registered early, automatically, and
        in parallel, while objects are identified separately”. It was made to
        determine which properties are detected preatentively, and how the human
        brain performs this process.
      </p>
      <p>Texton theory</p>
      <p>
        Developed by Bela Julész, to study texture patterns and if features are
        detected by the human visual system. He determined that there are three
        textons. Elongated blobs: specific properties such as hue, orientation,
        and width. For example, line segments, rectangles, ellipses;
        terminators: ends of line segments; crossings of line segments. It is
        believed that only a difference in textons or in their density can be
        detected preattentively.
      </p>
      <p>Similarity theory</p>
      <p>
        This theory focuses on search time for perception. Search time depends
        on the amount of information needed to identify an object and how easily
        that object is distinguished from distractors.
      </p>
      <p>Guided search theory</p>
      <p>
        Made by JeremyWolfe, it is a two-stage model of visual processing in
        which initial parallel search mechanisms direct subsequent serial search
        mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>Thoughts</p>
      <p>
        Although the main summarized text by Li primarily focuses on
        quantitative data, there is need to know how one might record or
        visualise qualitative data. Nelson (2006), suggests that this type of
        knowledge (qualitative) is knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge of
        how to, whereas quantitative knowledge is factual and “is typically
        articulated in a set of testable and falsifiable propositions” (Nelson,
        2006). Nelson suggests ways in which one can access qualitative
        knowledge. In particular, he speaks about practice-as-research. This is
        used when words are unable to communicate the knowledge, however,
        workshop education affords insights into data. For example, you may be
        unable to describe to someone your process of riding a bicycle and how
        you keep your balance, however, as the researcher attempts to ride the
        bicycle on their own, they are able to learn and understand how to keep
        their balance. Qualitative data may further serve as evidence, for
        example, an eye witness statement or a survey about someone’s
        experiences.
