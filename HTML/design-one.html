      <p>Side navigation</p>
      <p>
        The side navigation was chosen for this project based on the aesthetics
        of the website pictured below. Choosing a navigation bar in this format
        will provide users with expected logic when using devices with smaller
        screens - click on the burger button and you are presented with a menu
        pop up on the left side of your screen.

          src="/Images/inspo1.png"

        />
      </p>
      <p>Colour</p>
      <p>
        The colours used within this site consist of black, white, and shades
        in-between. This choice was made to make images stand out within the
        website. In terms of the data visualisations, this might become
        inportant when representing information within text - a purple bubble of
        30%, for example, stands out within a site that uses mainly one colour.
      </p>
      <p>Data visualisation</p>
      <p>
        Despite there being no wireframe for the data visualisation at current,
        I have gathered ways in which I feel the data may be represented in a
        fun way, however, I feel that it may become cluttered and irrelevant
        depending on my chosen API.

      <p>Rough wireframes for the blog, design and home pages</p>
      <p class="u-image">
        <img

          alt="Wireframe of the pages which use cards"
        />

      <p class="u-image">
        <img
          src="/Images/contentpages1.png"
          alt="Wireframe of pages with lots of readable content"
        />
      </p>
      <p>Text</p>
      <p>
        The text is not in a particular font, however, I would like to make use
        of a text which is both easy to read, whilst still still feeling
        different from the usual fonts such as Arial or Times New Roman. The
        navigation options make us of small case letters as text which is
        written in the same case (small or capital) is easier to read and makes
        the overall design feel more cohesive.
